It was designed to be the go-to server for [Rubinius](http://rubini.us), but also works well with JRuby and MRI. Puma is intended for use in both development and production environments.\n\nUnder the hood, Puma processes requests using a C-optimized Ragel extension (inherited from Mongrel) that provides fast, accurate HTTP 1.1 protocol parsing in a portable way. Puma then serves the request in a thread from an internal thread pool (which you can control). This allows Puma to provide real concurrency for your web application!\n\nWith Rubinius 2.0, Puma will utilize all cores on your CPU with real threads, meaning you won't have to spawn multiple processes to increase throughput. You can expect to see a similar benefit from JRuby.\n\nOn MRI, there is a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) that ensures only one thread can be run at a time. But if you're doing a lot of blocking IO (such as HTTP calls to external APIs like Twitter), Puma still improves MRI's throughput by allowing blocking IO to be run concurrently (EventMachine-based servers such as Thin turn off this ability, requiring you to use special libraries). Your mileage may vary. In order to get the best throughput, it is highly recommended that you use a Ruby implementation with real threads like [Rubinius](http://rubini.us) or [JRuby](http://jruby.org)." },

The AWS Flow Framework is a Ruby framework that uses the Amazon Simple Workflow APIs to coordinate units of work, modeled as Ruby classes and methods, across distributed machines. The framework provides an easy way for developers to build a state machine that knows what's happening across these distributed units of work and to know what steps need to be processed next. The framework also provides easy-to-use abstractions for many core distributed computing patterns, like parallel execution of work, exception handling for asynchronous code, and exponential retry of failed work.  On top of that, the Amazon Simple Workflow service helps audit and maintain the history of work that has transpired across many different machines and makes this information available at any time for debugging the distributed application. Using the AWS Flow Framework in Ruby, developers can execute distributed Ruby code asynchronously without building complicated abstractions that are hard to implement and difficult to debug.\r\n In this session, we will walk through a use case to show how to solve difficult distributed systems problems using the AWS Flow Framework in Ruby and Amazon Simple Workflow.
