    <h2>Seattle Ruby Brigade</h2>
    <p>
      Seattle.rb was the first Ruby (and subsequently Ruby on Rails) user group in the world and has met regularly for well over a decade. We convene every Tuesday night to contribute to open source, work on personal projects, and teach and learn from one another. All skill levels are welcome!
